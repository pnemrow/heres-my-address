# Here's My Address

It's really annoying having to fill out your address or phone number every time one of your friends is loses their phone or wants to send you something in the mail. Its annoying to have to go and ask for this information either because you forgot, or the information has since changed.

Here's My Address will allow you to add your information once in a central location, and then allow your friends to access the information without having to bother you. If your friends use it, collecting their information will be as easy as checking a box.
